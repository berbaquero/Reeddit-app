# Reeddit for Mac - An Amazing Project

This is a version of [Reeddit](https://github.com/berbaquero/reeddit/), built for OS X, using [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).

[Download Reeddit.app](https://github.com/berbaquero/Reeddit-app/releases/download/v1.9.6/Reeddit.app.zip).

For now, you will need to update manually - download each new version. I hope to work on a way to auto-update later.

# Reeddit

* #### Minimalist
While aiming for simplicity, Reeddit cares to show you only the most important information from the posts and comments. No upvotes or points.

* #### Elastic
Reeddit has 3 different elastic layouts - you can use it on any window size. So it's comfortable to use on a smartphone, tablet or desktop.

* #### Read-only
Being a personal side-project of mine, Reeddit can be used for browsing subreddits and viewing links/post and its comments, but not for voting or commenting... for now ;) -- However, the subreddits and channels you add are saved locally, so you don't lose any of that data.

* #### Channels
You can group different subreddits into a Channel, so you can browse their links in a single view, instead of having to browse each one separately. This is specially useful when you add subject-related subreddits.

## Tools

To build Reeddit, I used these awesome resources:

*	[pagedown](http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/) -- Client-side Markdown-to-HTML conversion.
*	[Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) -- Lightweigth client-side templating.
*	[reziseend.js](https://github.com/porada/resizeend) -- Better 'resize' handler.
* [Iconmonstr](http://iconmonstr.com/) -- Awesome icons.

### Compatibility

Reeddit.app works on OS X 10.7 and up.
